<a href="https://www.demetrikofinas.com/">Demetri Kofinas</a> interviews some of the most brilliant minds in science, technology, finance, politics, and culture as he uncovers the underlying forces driving the most powerful changes we see in the world.<br>

What drives the changes we see in the world? What are the underlying forces that influence our lives? What causes markets to rise and fall? Why does life sometimes imitate art? Why do we seem to disagree more than ever before in our politics? What determines what you see on Facebook?<br>

My name is Demetri Kofinas, and I've spent the better part of my life asking these questions. I built my career in media obsessing over them. For me, this has always been a quest to discover the true nature of my world, where I come from and where Iâ€™m going. This is about uncovering and understanding the mystery of a world that is so rich and beautiful in its design and function, that to not wonder at its magnificence is to miss something profound.<br>

If you ask yourself these questions or if they inspire you to wonder more about the reality you are living in, about where things come from, how they came to be, how they work and what it all means for you, then stay tuned!<br>
